# Intersection Algorithms
A project with helps of professor
## Ideas
This project is to figure out the time complexity of tuple, list, doulbe for loop(which means a loop in another for loop), and the combination of for loop and if statment. To dect the time consumption, I used profiler method. Finally, I found that I find that the listsingle
is the fastest one and the tupledouble is the slowest one. And I want to explain it below
in 2 aspects, tuple and list, and double and single.

For the difference between tuple and list, the most prominent one is that tuple is immutable and
list is mutable. This divergence results in the situation that list has the method `append` to add objects or 
values into the end of the initial list, which is a feature that tuple doesn't have.
Instead, what tuple can do to `add` something in it is by the way of using `+=` operator .
And the nature of this operator is actually replace the initial tuple and add a new element into the new one which uses
the same assignment name. The result of this approach is the fact that everytime you want to `add` a new element,
you'd have to cover the elements in the initial again. For this reason, the project can be huge and time-consuming
when there are hundards of elements in the initial tuple.

To figure out the difference between single for loop and double for loop, I'd like to use some concepts about time complexity.
single for loop is totally a  linear function. The relationship between double for loop and time consumption, however, is a quartic
function. So the degree of increasement of time consumption can be so prominent.
